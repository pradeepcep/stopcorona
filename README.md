# StopCorona API

Unofficial open public API for the info on https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in/, written in Python/Django.


## üîé Caveats and Considerations
* https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in/ is a public resource helping people in a time of need. Please be mindful of how often you make automated queries.
* The motivation behind this API is to provide a free, accessible, available API of COVID-19 facilities to enable others to build useful things that might help people.
* While this API is open to the public and free to use, I'm running it out of pocket. Please use it for something meaningful, and please be mindful of how much automated queries you send this way. üôè
* Used this API to build something cool? I'd love to hear about it! Please tweet at üê¶ [@pradeepcep](https://twitter.com/pradeepcep) and let me know!
